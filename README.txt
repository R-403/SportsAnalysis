Sports analysis
Randy Gomez
This simulates how you have to analyze the results of the last 4 years of your college team. You have data files that list the results of every event of the 10 schools in your division for several years.
The program uses the users information brought into the terminal and check from two files that they want to compare, the two teams, then 
The user only has to type the run line and then theyll get the results they need, see which ones tie or who has more wins and the such.
To compile:
make
Uses the makefile and type make into the terminal
Or 
To make it run 
./runScores scores20.txt scores21.txt...results.txt
Your program should be run with the following command line arguments
where the last command line argument is the name of the output file and arguments 1 to N-1
are the names of the input files.
Sources: this program was made by Randy with a little help from lecture slides and examples within the class files to see how to connect the two files and use different lines to do things between classes
